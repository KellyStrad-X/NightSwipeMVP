# Shared Assets Dropzone

Use this folder to share logos, screenshots, or other reference assets with the agent team. Files placed here are version-controlled, so you can copy/paste images from the host machine and commit them for in-VM access.

Suggested workflow:
1. Drop new assets into `assets/shared/` (e.g., `nightswipe-logo.png`, `phase2-swipe-demo.jpg`).
2. Add a short note in your sprint log or summary referencing the filenames so agents know what to look for.
3. Remove or archive assets when they are superseded to keep git history tidy.

Feel free to create subfolders (e.g., `logos/`, `screenshots/`, `branding/`) as the collection grows.
